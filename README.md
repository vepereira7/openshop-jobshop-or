# Open shop and Job shop Scheduling Problem

This project, carried out as part of Operations Research course, consists of choosing an optimization problem, designing and testing both a mathematical programming (MIP) model and a constraint programming (CP) model for the problem, and reporting on the findings of the analysis of each model and comparison of the two models.

It is divided into two stages: design, implementation and test of the MIP model; and design, implementation and test of the CP model, as well as comparison between the MIP and CP models. The data can be found [here](http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/ordonnancement.dir/ordonnancement.html).
